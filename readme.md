## üìå Overview
An AI-powered lead management and qualification app.  
It captures prospect information such as **name, email, company, and company size** and enriches it with behavioral signals:  

- **Pages visited**  
- **Time spent on each page**  
- **Number of questions asked**  

Using these signals, the app automatically decides whether the prospect is a **potential customer** (hot/warm lead) or not.

All captured leads are stored in an Excel file (`leads.xlsx`) with relevant details and a timestamp.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Extracts **lead details** from free-form user input.  
- Tracks **behavioral signals** (page visits, time, questions asked).  
- Automatically computes **qualification score** and **lead quality**.  
- Saves structured data into an Excel file.  
- Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive UI.
